# Developing a Job Description and Resume Matching System Using Python and Machine Learning

This project focuses on creating a system that matches job descriptions with resumes using Python and machine learning techniques. The goal is to streamline the recruitment process by automating resume-job description matching, enabling recruiters to quickly identify qualified candidates.

## Key Features

- **Job Description Submission:** Recruiters can input job descriptions into the system.
- **Resume Upload:** Candidates can submit their resumes for comparison with job descriptions.
- **Matching Algorithm:** Machine learning algorithms are employed to assess the similarity between job descriptions and resumes, producing matching scores.
- **Results Display:** The system presents matched resumes to recruiters, complete with similarity scores and other relevant details.

## Technologies Utilized

- **Python:** Used for backend development.
- **Flask:** A web framework to handle the backend server and HTTP requests.
- **Bootstrap:** Utilized for creating a responsive and user-friendly frontend UI.
- **Machine Learning Libraries:** Tools like scikit-learn are applied for implementing text similarity matching algorithms.
- **HTML/CSS:** Used for web page structure and styling.
